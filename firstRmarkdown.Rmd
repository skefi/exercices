```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # settings for the whole doc
#echo to show code or not
#eval to show results or not
#include = false means echo and eval and xx is false
```

yaml (yet another markup langage) allows to add table of content. Careful with the indentation (2 spaces).

## R Markdown {-}

The {-} removes the number next to that title.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r table}
library(DT) #only works for html outputs
DT::datatable(iris, 
              rownames=FALSE, 
              options=list(pagelength=10, 
                           scrolly="100px"))

#cars %>% head(5) %>% 
```
